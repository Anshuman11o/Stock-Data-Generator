Stock Data Visualizer

Created a web application for real-time visualization of NASDAQ 100 stock prices.
Featuring dynamic graphs and data points to facilitate stock trend analysis for traders.
Built the app with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, using Chart.js to display dynamic graphs.
Fetched NASDAQ 100 stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.

I created a HTML page for this web application and edited it using CSS.
Then I made connection with stock API using JavaScript.
After retrieving all the data from the API, I used all the data to present it in a table format in JavaScript.
Then I took the data from the API and built a chart using Chart.js.
Here I used the timeline and closing prices data to build a chart which clearly visualises the stock price trend of a selected stock in a span of several months.
Then I made two more functions to display metrics for traders and highlight certain price points for the stock.
These metrics were again calculated and programmed in JavaScript and are essential for traders in their descision making.

Finally I let some users (traders) run the program and try it out.
I took their feedback on adjusting positionings of charts, tables and certain data poitns for better view.

Finally completed the project with all testing and changes complete.
